# 2025_GOOSE_2D_MaskDINO

This repository contains the implementation for **2D semantic segmentation** in the GOOSE 2025 challenge, based on **MaskDINO**.

## ðŸ”§ Architecture Overview

The model is built on top of the MaskDINO framework, which incorporates transformer-based encoder-decoder design with improved query-based denoising strategies and dynamic anchor boxes.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Based on **MaskDINO** for high-performance segmentation.
- Integrated improvements from:
  - DINO (DETR with Improved DeNoising)

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

Please follow the official [MaskDINO installation instructions](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/MaskDINO/blob/main/INSTALL.md).

> ðŸ”§ Note: Make sure to set up the same environment as MaskDINO before training or evaluation.

## ðŸ§  Model Components

- **Backbone**: Swin-Transformer / ResNet variants
- **Transformer Decoder**: DINO + DAB-DETR + Query Denoising
- **Segmentation Head**: MaskDINO
