# 2025_GOOSE_2D_MaskDINO

This repository contains the implementation for **2D semantic segmentation** in the GOOSE 2025 challenge, based on **MaskDINO**.

## ðŸ”§ Architecture Overview

The model is built on top of the MaskDINO framework, which incorporates transformer-based encoder-decoder design with improved query-based denoising strategies and dynamic anchor boxes.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Based on **MaskDINO** for high-performance segmentation.
- Integrated improvements from:
  - DINO (DETR with Improved DeNoising)
  - DN-DETR (Query Denoising)
  - DAB-DETR (Dynamic Anchor Boxes)
